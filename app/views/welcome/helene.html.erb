Helene has facilitated face-to-face language exchange workshops at the Club
d'échange linguistique de Montréal language school (CELM) in Montreal, Canada
for over 3 years. Her workshops have earned great praise among her <a href="WorkshopsTestimonials.asp">students</a> for being truly unique and effective 
as well as being thoroughly enjoyable and fun. As a result, many of her students have been repeat customers. Also, many new students
were referred by language teachers from the local universities, such as McGill
University and Concordia University. She even had referrals from other private language
schools in the city.<br><br>

<p>
Helene created what is now the Cormier method back in 1998. The absence of established teaching techniques that ensure
meaningful constructive practice with native speakers made this a necessity. Through original research, creativity and 
experimentation, Helene created and eventually perfected the Cormier method. Helene endeavors now to use the method and 
the Internet to help language learners all over the world become more fluent in their second language - and have fun doing it!</p>

<p>Helene co-founded the CELM language school in 1998. She is also a co-founder of MyLanguageExchange.com. 
In 1996, she taught ESL at the prestigious YBM Sisa language school in Korea. Helene has a BA from McGill University in French Translation and is an MA candidate for Creative Writing.</p>
Helene is completely fluent in French and English, has a good basis for speaking Spanish and has some knowledge of Korean.

<p>Helene's hobbies include learning languages, cooking, playing the piano, listening
to all types of music – from Mahler to Manu Chao, reading about Zen and writing
short stories.
