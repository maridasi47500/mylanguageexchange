"I must say that it's been great!. My first language is Spanish and I'm learning Greek. 
I've been looking around on the net for months just to find someone to practice that language, 
but without any success. I was also looking for someone to voice chat, so I thought that it 
was going to be impossible.<br>

<br>
When I saw that there were four Greeks registered on your site and one of them wanted to 
voice chat, I went crazy! I sent him a message and he answered to me a few days later. 
That was about three weeks ago, and ever since we've been talking and our level of knowledge 
has increased a lot.<br>
<br>
I haven't used the lesson plans nor the how-to guides. I'm quite a very communicative person 
myself and I always have something to talk about (our conversations last two or more hours 
every time we meet!!). <br>
<br>
I must congratulate you for such a great site. I'm telling all my friends about it, and 
some have already registered!<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for your help. You made my dream come true. Thank you so much."<br>

Hi there,<br>
<br>
I just want to tell you how fantastic my experience has been with MyLanguageExchange. I've been corresponding now with one language exchange member for almost a year, and another for a few months. One of my biggest challenges in learning Arabic has been speaking and oral comprehension, and my weekly, hour-long practice sessions with one exchange partner have helped tremendously with this. The other partner prefers a written exchange, but we're both huge language nerds and love chatting about the ins and outs of Arabic and English grammar. So that's been a ton of fun, and I've learned a lot from him about Arabic grammar! I think both these folks will be life-long friends. The one that I've been chatting with for almost a year is someone I feel comfortable telling literally anything going on in my life, and I think she feels the same way. Who knew I'd be able to do it in Arabic!<br>
<br>
Anyway I logged back on to find another conversation partner now that work has calmed down a bit and I have some more time. Thank you for this wonderful service. My Arabic has really improved, and I've made two wonderful friends in the process. Take care, and feel free to use this on your site if helpful.<br>

Congratulations!<br>
<br>
Hello, <br>
This is an amazing site. So easy to use and so handy !<br>
I discovered My Language during the lock-down. Thank you so much.<br>
<br>
...In addition, I would like to say that the field "Description contains" is very powerful and helps a lot to find somebody sharing the same areas of interest : writer, musician, etc ...<br>
<br>
Thanks !<br>
<br>
Another valuable aspect of MLE is the absence of advertisements on the website. It is so relaxing for the eye and to me it also makes the site authentic.
Thanks Dan and have a good day,<br>
<br>

Dear Dan, <br>
<br>
my name is Paolo and I am an engineer who live close to Venice. <br>
I have no word to thank you for your website. Honestly, it has improved my life. 
I met here incredible people. Sometimes these people have become friends. 
Last but not least, It helped me to improve my English. Before writing/chatting here,
 I was a bad at speaking/writing English. Now... It is so so better. <br>
 <br>
If you come to Venice in the future, I would like to shake hands personally and offer you a good glass 
of italian wine. <br>
<br>
Thanks to all again. <br>
Bye. <br>

Hello Dan!<br>
<br>
thx a lot and congratulation for your website !<br>
<!--Could you post my testimonial please? <br-->
<br>
Fin 2013, j‚Äôen avais assez de prendre des cours d‚ÄôAnglais ‚Äò‚Äôclassiques‚Äô‚Äô Je trouvais que c‚Äô√©tait ennuyeux, et que je ne progressais pas assez. J‚Äôai donc d√©cid√© de m‚Äôinscrire gratuitement sur ce site que j‚Äôavais d√©couvert par hasard, car correspondre avec un √©tranger, je trouvais le concept int√©ressant et fun
Tr√®s vite, j‚Äôai √©t√© contact√© par Paddy qui √©tait ‚Äò‚Äôgold member‚Äô‚Äô. Nous avons commenc√© a nous √©changer des emails et ensuite nous nous sommes contacter par Skype .
Nous avons vite sympathis√© ainsi qu‚Äôavec sa femme Julie. Tr√®s vite nous nous sommes rencontr√©s pour la premi√®re fois en France. Ensuite j‚Äôai eu plusieurs fois l‚Äôoccasion d‚Äôaller en Angleterre et de d√©couvrir la famille de Paddy et Julie, ainsi que leurs amis. Depuis, j‚Äôai fait beaucoup de progr√®s en Anglais. 
Depuis plus de trois ans maintenant, nous sommes quotidiennement en contact.<br> 
<br>
Grace a Mylanguageexchange, je n‚Äôai pas seulement correspondu avec un √©tranger, j‚Äôai aussi rencontr√© mon meilleur ami !<br>
<br>
Maintenant je suis "gold member" et j'aimerai rencontr√© d'autres personnes dans d'autres pays!<br>
<br>
<i>[Translation by Google Translator...
At the end of 2013, I was tired of taking classes of English "classics" I thought it was boring, and that I did not progress enough. I decided to register for free on this site that I had discovered by chance, because to correspond with a stranger, I found the concept interesting and fun
Soon, I was contacted by Paddy who was a gold member. We started exchanging emails and then we got in touch with Skype.
We quickly sympathized as well as with his wife Julie. Very soon we met for the first time in France. Then I had several times the opportunity to go to England and discover the family of Paddy and Julie, as well as their friends. Since then, I have made a lot of progress in English.
For more than three years now, we are in daily contact.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Mylanguageexchange, I not only corresponded with a stranger, I also met my best friend!<br>
<br>
Now I am "gold member" and I would like to meet other people in other countries!

Hey Dan, <br>
I just purchased Gold membership and I have to say I dont regret it one bit. <br>
Comparing the Gold features of your website to the features of other language sites it really 
makes me see that there is no competition. Looks like the subscription fees are indeed worth it!<br>
Thanks for changing my mind. <br>

Thank you for your excellent website, which has all the features I need and is very easy to use. 
I am bi-lingual English-Spanish, recently began to study European Portuguese, and just went to a 
language school there for three months. I was very happy with my progress in reading and writing 
Portuguese. However, once I came back to the USA, I needed more practice speaking. As the old saying 
goes: "Use it or loose it". Joining your website was the "missing link" in my self-study program. 
I now have quite a few wonderful language exchange partners in Portugal. My new Portuguese friends 
are coming to visit me here and I will soon go visit them there.  My spoken Portuguese has improved 
dramaticallly in a few short months. For me, as a retired person, your site has helped me continue to 
grow and remain engaged with the world around me. In addition, I have been accepted to study for a 
semester at a university in Portugal, started publishing short stories in Portuguese, and really feel 
at home in Portuguese and amoung the Portuguese. I could not be happier with MyLanguageExchange. 
It is a powerful tool for connecting people, improving foreign language fluency, and building an 
international community. With appreciation, Gerardo do Arizona<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Gerardo do Arizona<br>

My maternal tongue is Spanish and I practice English and French.
I've been in MLE for 8 years and since then, I've met many friends to practice. 
Now both of them are my great friends and I've visited them in USA and France, 
and I¬´ve invited them to visit Mexico.<br> 
<br> 
It¬´s been wonderful to find this partners and practice with them... personally!<br>

Hi Dan, I am pleased to inform you that I joined my membership as a gold member several days ago. 
I had several responses from my language partners.

Hi Dan, I wanted to add the following comments:   In just three days I had received seven responses.  
These members are so interested and excited in practicing their languages and help their partners. 
Your language exchange program makes the language learning come alive.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I am gradually learning the site and its benefits to the members, I will grow more in 
Understanding how to improve more in my Japanese learning. It is the most effective tool I have tried.<br> 
<br>
Congratulations to you and your team members for developing this great website. Keeping on trucking!

...I made acquaintance with Eileen through MyLanguageExchange.com. She was the partner I was looking for. 
We have been working together for 6 years now and I can say that they were 6 years of steady, continuous improvement in listening, 
understanding and speaking English. It was done from home, at hours that were convenient for me and for no cost.<br>
<br>
The improvement came through totally free talks. Depending on the circumstances, we discussed questions of the moment, 
risen by the media, or other issues that one or the other of the 2 partners was interested in. Sometimes the talk was about an 
important event unfolding somewhere in the world, could it be in the US, France or Middle East. Other times, it was on subjects 
related to religion, economy, science or any other matter. Thus, I learned to better understand how Canadians think, live and do things. <br>
<br>
Later, the relationship deepened into friendship. In 2011, my wife and I got to spend Christmas time as Eileen and Andrew‚Äôs guests in Ottawa. 
They served as guides to us through the celebrations and they took us to the Christmas mass at an Anglican church. They introduced us to 
English speaking Canadians we would otherwise never have met. I hope that, in the other hand, Eileen and Andrew enjoyed being with us in 
Montreal and that they learned a bit about how North Africans like us think and live.<br>
<br>
And all that was possible thanks to MyLanguageExchange.com website and to Skype system. <br>

<!--A year ago in March, I met a woman online. She lives in Colombia, and I live in the US. She doesn't speak English (still, which is my fault!), 
and when I met her, my Spanish was limited. I met her in person after months of talking, and fell in love. I still go and see her when I can, 
and we have been dating now for seven months. <br>
<br>
I go back in a month, and -->I can't express the thanks that I have for this page. It was through the hands of God that I found this page, and I 
thank him every chance I can.<br>
<br>
Keep doing what you guys are doing, because not only do you change the way we learn language, but also the way we live. This is my language exchange, 
and it's not only given me the chance to become very fluent in Spanish, but also the chance to meet the person that I love so dearly.<br>
<br>
God bless you all. <br>

Dear Dan,<br>
<br>
Thanks for your email. I am so happy with the Language Exchange website. This is the best way to learn a language that I have found.
I have been trying to learn Spanish for several years and talking with a language partner through your site has worked beyond everything else.
Thanks for such a great website!<br>

Hello Dan,<br>
<br>
...I truly love your website and find myself visiting the language exchange website more than any other site on the Internet.
I have made many friends who are interested in language exchanges. Because of these friendships I am learning so much about other cultures
and the way of life in many other parts of the world...<br>

Dear Mr. Yuen, <br>
<br>
I just want to take a moment and let you know how much I am enjoying MLE. I have met the NICEST people through your site. I have friends who I recommend your site to because, when they find out I have pen pals in Jordan, Egypt and Cairo they are green with envy and want to meet new people too. 
I am planning a trip to Beijing soon, and I have no doubt I will meet plenty of folks to share cultural exchange with and learn about the city from the locals. (That's always the best way to get to know a city.)
Finally, I've been sharing recipes with a pen pal in Jordan. I just filmed and posted on my facebook account the result of the latest cooking adventure. I plan to put it on youtube and will send you the link if you are interested. Now HIS family wants an American recipe and he is filming his home and city for my family to see. 
None of this would have happened without you. THANK YOU! I think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. <br>
<br>
Very Sincerely, <br>

Dear Dan,<br>
<br> 
By all means, please post my comments in your testimonials section.... and please feel free to fix any of my typos! : )<br>
 <br>
In my youth I was able to work and travel all over the globe and met interesting, wonderful people. I really miss that. Now I have a practice, and a family with two small children. International travel is just not something I get to do anymore. However, with your website, I am a few clicks away from making international friends again. I really think this is a grass roots way any individual can promote peace and prosperity in our world. You have made my world better. Thank you.<br>

Hi Dear Dan,<br>
<br>
I hope you are well and everything is ok there :-)<br>
<br>
I took my speaking exam last Thursday and the main exam on Saturday. I m not sure about the writing part in the main exam but i will get the mark i need in other parts and about the speaking part i should say it is much better and easier than I thought before. I wanted to say it couldn't be like this if you wasn't. You and your site was the most important help and i m really grateful for that. <br>

Thank you again very very much,<br>

Dear Dan,<br>
<br>
We want to thank you for your fantastic website. WE met here two years ago. 
David was looking for a way to improve his English for work. Briana was looking for a chance to meet people and improve her French.
We expected to find correspondants, but what we also found is a the truly wonderful friendship.<br>
<br>
David and his family have come to the US twice to visit Briana's family. Briana has traveled in France
and will return with her entire family to stay with David's family next summer. We are both now fluent in the other's language. We share more than just language. We share culture, food, hobbies, music, and friendship. It was far more than we ever expected.<br>
<br>
Thanks for making it possible.<br>
Briana and David<br>

Ciao! <br>
I've been using your site since spring 2006, and I have made many wonderful friends through it. I live in the US and my friends live in Italy. I have met several of them on my trips to Italy.<br>
<br>
My life has completely changed because of the opportunity to become friends with these wonderful people who are dedicated to our language exchanges through email and Skype. Because of this, I have hope than I can become fluent in Italian.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for making this possible through the creation of this site! <br>
grazie mille! <br>

MyLanguageExchange ROCKS. <br>
<br>
  In March I was accepted into New Bulgarian University master of science
program. Living in the USA, I did not know any of the Bulgarian language.
Though the program is in English, I wanted to learn enough Bulgarian to get 
myself around when I arrived to Sofia. I will be here for two years.<br>
<br>
  Immediately after my acceptance, I joined MyLanguageExchange and emailed
about 50 English speaking Bulgarians from Sofia. Over the following months, 
I made a dozen or so friends from Sofia who helped me out a great deal. I
also met a few Bulgarians in Cincinnati, where I was living.<br>
<br>
  During those months, through MyLanguageExchange, I found a tutor to teach 
me BG in cincinnati. I found a Bulgarian who had a vacant flat in Sofia
where I am now living. I found an English professor at New Bulgarian
University who is helping me get a job teaching English at the University. I 
found many Bulgarian friends in Sofia who have helped me tramendously since
my arrival one week ago today.<br>
<br>
  Without MyLanguageExchange, I would have been absolutely lost here in
Sofia. But now I have friends and a very effective network that all formed 
before my arrival.<br>
<br>
  I will continue to use MLE to meet more Bulgarians in Sofia. Thank you
MLE!<br>

Dear Dan, dear "My language exchange.com",<br>
<br>
I'm just writing to say "THANK YOU" to you, thank you a thousand times for your marvellous website. So far I have only used very little of what you offer but it has helped me so much to improve my French and to find new friends, really interesting and nice people. You warn people not to use their real address and not to meet their pen pals in person and you are right to do so. However, I did risk a bit and have met three of my pen pals in person and they are all great. Thanks to your website I met a Frenchman who is now a good friend of mine, I spent a wonderful week in France with him and his family (this was one of my dreams and it came true)and then he and his family came to Slovakia and now both our families are befriended! <br>
<br>
Your website is trustworthy, reliable, incredibly rich and helpful. What a brilliant idea it was! <br>
<br>
I am a language teacher and I recommend you to all of my students. <br>
<br>
Wishing you all the best,<br>
Lucia Bujnova<br>

Hi Dan,<br>
<br>
of course you can reproduce my comments in your Member Testimonials 
section! "Lucia Bujnova" is my real name and you can include all of it, 
what I have written is what I believe and I want to encourage other 
people to sign up because it is definitely worth it. Anonymous letters 
are less convincing, I think. If you also want to give a link to my 
profile, you can.<br>
<br>
By the way, one of those three pen pals that I have already met in 
person comes from Canada, which is really far from Slovakia! :) I can 
see that you are Canadian, too.<br>
<br>
I think that if everybody spoke a few foreign languages and got to know 
a few foreigners, learning about their culture, trying to understand or 
to a certain extent accept their way of thinking, there would be fewer 
international conflicts and maybe fewer wars. Your website not only 
helps people learn foreign languages, it also gives them an opportunity 
to make friends all over the world, which is very valuable. (You can 
reproduce that too if you like. :)  )<br>
<br>
Well, best of luck to you, Dan, and to your wonderful website!<br>
Lucia<br>
<br>

Absolutely, words cannot describe the value I have derived from this 
extraordinary club. Please provide me with information concerning my next 
membership dues. Over the period of time I have enjoyed membership, I lost 
track of when the next membership payment is due. Please advise concerning 
this. This club has been an extraordinary joy for me and I plan on 
maintaining membership for many years to come.<br>

Yes of course you can reproduce the comments. Within the last three days I 
returned from a two week trip visiting friends, from our club, in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil. (I reside in Chicago, USA) This club is a gateway to the world, and 
for individuals attempting to expand their minds, this is the ideal method. 
Thank you for arguably the most productive language club on the entire 
Internet. I'll pay my dues in advance.<br>

Hello<br>
<br>
I have been using your Gold service for the past several months and I just have 
to say that it has been fantastic. I was able to connect with an incredible 
language partner who has been extremely helpful in my quest to learn Swahili. 
Thank you so much for providing this service.<br>

Dear Dan Yuen<br>
<br>
I just wanted to drop you a note to say Thank You for this wonderful site.  
I met my Japanese penpal in Japan a couple of weeks ago when my family and 
I traveled from the US to Japan for vacation.<br>
<br>
We had a wonderful time together and she took us sightseeing and we were invited to 
dinner to meet her family. They were very kind,`generous, 
helpful and hospitable. They have invited us to stay with them the next time we visit Japan. 
We have also invited them to stay with us should they ever visit the USA.<br>
<br>
Through your site, I have made wonderful friends in Japan.<br>
<br>
Thank You!

I started out to learn a few words of Swahili in prep for a visit to 
Tanzania.  Now I have friends in a town I will visit, I know
more Swahili then I ever expected, understand some of the culture, swapped 
family photos, text chat almost every day, and more!<br>

I joined as a gold member sometime last year. I met with a lot of 
people online and in person through your site. Not only did I
improve in my language skills (Japanese), but I also was able to 
get a job and move to the country of that language (Japan). This

You can quote me on this, but I think&nbsp;it's a truly remarkable and wonderful site 
that&nbsp;you have going. It gives people such as myself a place to go and truly 
learn a language; not from a CD ROM or from lessons, but from the natives that 
actually speak it. The many&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;I see are that I can learn from the most 
realistic perspective possible, and even learn things&nbsp;one couldn't learn 
anywhere else in a language, such as slang or common phrases. Keep doing what 
you do. The best of luck, and God bless.<br>

Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
I have always wanted a language exchange partner. I searched the Internet for months, but in vain. I logged onto your website, and found one the next day.<br>

Some language learners compare the Internet to a gold mine. I think MyLanguageExchange.com is a mine lamp, without which you have to dig in darkness.<br>

I am really impressed by the way you make it possible for people wanting
to learn/improve a language to get in touch with each other.<br>
<br>
I now have the real-time contact I need to implement and check what I
learn from texts.<br>
<br>
Linguistically, this site helps people get past that frustrating plateau
in language learning: being able to get by. With the knowledge, support
and experience of your email partner, you can take the risks required to
learn more complex language forms, as your partner can with your help.<br>
<br>
Caveat: when it comes to casual conversation, you can probably learn a
fair bit with a partner of average skills, but if you want to learn more,
check that your language partner has the depth of knowledge you need. It
is useful to shop around and compare the level of understanding people
appear to have of their first language. For example, many people can
converse idiomatically in English, but how many can explain why the
language is structured the way it is, or why you use a certain word
instead of another?<br>
<br>
With My Language Exchange, you have the whole world in front of you, so
the possibilities for partners of different levels are almost endless.<br>

Hi.  Just wanted to let you know how successful your site has been for me!
I met a new friend from your site.  Frank from Germany.  We have
corresponded by email and later by MSN Messenger since last October.  My
wife and I invited Frank to visit our family here in Colorado.  He came
over for 3 weeks in June and we had a super time hosting Frank and he got
along wonderfully with our entire family.  We now have a good friend in
Germany and we are planning a visit to Frank in
October.  Thanks for everything! <br>

Subject: Your site has opened up a life I only dreamed about!<br>
<br>        
I have encountered many sites on the web for language exchange and penpals
but none have surpassed what you have to offer.  I am a Spanish Major at a
university and my first language is English. I am increasing my speaking
and understanding skills so rapidly that I often find myself thinking in
Spanish, something that I had only dreamed about in the past. Your site
has allowed me to find not only a language exchange partner but someone
with which I know I will have a lifelong friendship.  The individuals who
come to mylanguageexchange.com are serious about helping each other to
learn to communicate freely and expressively in another language and this
alone, the caliber of the community here, far surpases what I have
encountered thus far. Bravo for a job well done!  Thank you very much for
opening up so many possibilities in my life for me and my family!

My fluency has increased so much that it is close to that of the native speakers 
in the university level classes I am enrolled in at the University of Texas at Tyler. 
They all ask me how I have become so fluent without going outside the country and 
I just say, "well, in essence I do travel outside the country, almost on a daily basis"...

A few month ago when I first signed up with mylangageexchange.com, 
I started off with a lot of language partners with the hope to improve 
both my Japanese and my Putonghua. The webpages had tons of contacts as 
well as lots of handy tips, so you really have to just give just about 
everyone who matches your search criteria a try. After a month or so, I 
decided to settle with one Japanese lady from Kyoto and a Chinese lady here in Hong Kong.<br> 
<br>
My Japanese partner is very keen to improve on her Cantonese - a bit of surprise to me 
as Cantonese is a spoken language not that often spoken outside the southern part of 
China. We exchanged a lot of emails and I must say that we didn't really follow the 
instructions from the webpage. Last month, I had a chance to actually visit her in Japan. 
We went visiting together so many interesting places which I would not have been able to 
visit without a native speaker, shrine, local university etc. It was so much fun to actually 
meet your language partner. Those few days were probably the most intensive language lessons 
we both have ever had in our life!<br>
<br>
As for my Putonghua partner, she was just perfect. Every other day, we had a phone conversation 
for about an hour, alternating in English and Putonghua. Since I live in the countryside in HK,
I spent quite a bit of time commuting and that turns out to be just perfect for some language 
practices. We talked about practically everything from Chinese culture, religion to where you 
can get the best dim sum in Hong Kong. I am going to invite her to my Toastmasters club where 
hopefully she would find more opportunities to strengthen her spoken English. For us, although 
we're both Chinese, it was very much a cultural lesson for both of us since we came from very 
different background - mainland China and Hong Kong are just like two different worlds and we 
are always surprised at how different people from the two places think.<br>
<br>
Thanks to mylanguageexchange.com, language learning has never been boring.<br>

Dear Dan<br>
<br>
This has to be one of the best free online sites I have discovered. There
is no doubt a great deal of effort has gone into endeavouring to create a
site that incorporates good language learning principles including the
intrinsically motivational aspects of interactivity.<br>
<br>
And no stone has been left unturned in ensuring the site's users
understand how to use each feature and facility in order to gain maximum
benefit from their online learning experience.<br>
<br>
What a site! You deserve wide reognition from around the globe for your
efforts.<br>
<br>
Thank you and with every good wish.<br>

Hi Dan,<br>
<br>
Your site helped me to find a partner and practice my foreign language.
Not being still a good speaker in this language, "the English",
unfortunelly, I didn't know what say, now I speak better, but I always
study to progress yet, and I haven't much time to exchange with much partner.<br>
<br>
It's very interesting, to have the exchanges with partner; to know others
countries, and other  ways to live.<br>
<br>
I'm glad to have your site to find partners to talk with.<br>

Hello Mr. Yuen, How are you?<br>
<br>
I am very pleased with your site and consider it one
of the best for language learning.
I have been looking mainly for Chinese in exchange
for English, Spanish or German, and I have got around 4
exchanges.
Wish you a big success with the page.<br>

I took part in this site before one month. I really appreciate you. 
This site is very helpful. I am Japanese. And I am practicing English. 
I found a few pen friends in this site. They are very good people, I guess. 
I have a lot of chances to write English recently. I will continue to study. 
And to help for people who wants to learn Japanese is very good for me, too. 
To teach is difficult but interesting. Thank you. Bye.<br>

Indeed, your site is an excellent way of practising foreign languages. If
you ask me, yes, I found a penpal in Florida who help me to improve my
English and in exchange I help her in progressing in French. Currently, our
mean of communication is by e-mail. We will see later for other ways of
correspondance. I read your lessons plans once : they are well done but as
I use e-mail I don't need to use them for the moment. 
Thank you very much for your site !<br>

Hi, Danny:<br>
<br>
Just to tell you that my language exchange is working wonderfully. I found a
French woman (from Paris) who was interested in improving her English and I
my French.<br>
<br>
We communicate daily (except weekends, as her computer is at her office) and
have written e-mails (only...no voice chat, no live chat). That seems to be
the best for both of us.<br>
<br>
We have been writing each other, as I said, virtually every day since the
10th of January (2001) and we really enjoy communicating with one another. I
think, for awhile, she had been e-mailing with another person (woman) in
California but she has let that one go. To my knowledge we only communicate
with each other.<br>
<br>
I have learned her last name and her work address and I've sent a couple of
presents to her little 4-year-old son. Since this package went through
customs she knows my address as well and she said she'll be sending me
something when she goes on her next vacation.<br>
<br>
I have found it very easy to keep up this kind of communications with her
and she feels the same way. It is conceivable that someday when I travel to
France I may even get a chance to meet her and her son...it would be nice. I
am happily married and there is absolutely nothing to this e-mail
relationship except totally platonic. My wife knows about it and thinks it's
a good way for me to keep up my French proficiency.<br>
<br>
One thing [my penpal] and I do is critique each other's
letters...when I write in French she corrects my mistakes and when she
writes in English I correct hers. We both enjoy this and seem to have
learned from our mistakes (though I still make some every time...that's the
nature of the beast, I'm afraid!).<br>
<br>
We also feel very free to write in our own language to each other whenever
we feel like it. For example, she just got back from a 4-day business trip
to Malta and she wrote me what came out to 3 pages worth of copy (when i
printed it out!)...all in French. It was great for me to read all that
French and to know that I understood virtually every word (I only had to
look up about 4 words).<br>
<br>
I do the same to her frequently...if I'm too tired to write something long
or complicated in French (not my native tongue!!), I write her in English
and she gets the workout.<br>
<br>
We couldn't be happier with the exchange. Thank you for setting it all up.<br>
<br>
One more thing. Because of the frequency and intensity of our
correspondence, I cannot see myself getting into another exchange now.
Perhaps if [my penpal] and I stop writing one another then I will look into
another pen pal.<br>
<br>
Thank you for everything.<br>

Dear Danny, It has been a great experience for me so far. I have just done 
e-mails, but the people I have met have been very nice. Usually we write half 
in my language and half their language. We correct each others' grammar too 
usually. They've also given me some good info on an area in France that I 
will visit this summer. Two of the people that I correspond with contacted 
me, which I thought was wonderful. I really was hesitant about putting in my 
age, however. I would like people to write to me no matter what my age is... <br>
Anyway, this is my #1 favorite online site. Thanks...

Hi, I got your e-mail asking for input and thought I'd let you 
know how pleased I was to use your service.&nbsp; I haven't used any of the 
voice&nbsp;services, but I connected with an e-mail "pen-pal" and we have continued 
to send mail back and forth to each other.&nbsp; I am a student majoring in 
elementary education, with a Spanish concentration, so this is the next best 
thing to actually speaking to someone and gives me good practical experience.&nbsp; 
My schedule is too hectic at the moment to pursue any other contacts, but I hope 
to do so in the future.&nbsp; At the beginning when I had difficulty filling out the 
form, you responded immediately and I was able to get through with your 
suggestions.&nbsp; I recommended your site to my Spanish professors and other 
students.&nbsp; I think it's a great idea!&nbsp; Hopefully I will use it more in the 
future as a teacher.&nbsp; Thanks.

All in all, I like this site!!  As I said before, "finally something useful
on the internet."  It is a good way to concentrate those people who are
interested in learning a language (like me) without having to go over dozens
and dozens of emails (like those dating sites) finding someone interested in
language exchange.<br>

I'm an English as a Second Language teacher in the United States, and I
just wanted to let you know that you have a very nice site.  It's great
that there is a place that students of foreign languages can go to chat
with others that are looking for the same thing.  When I get my own site
going (I have lots of work ahead, so it will be a while...), I'll be sure
and send people to yours.  Again, I really am happy to see a site that is
dedicated to those serious about language learning and where PRACTICE is
the concept!  I've tried the chat rooms on the big search engines, but
they are filled with strange people.  Yours looks much more serious.  I'm
sure you've received lots of compliments. - Katerina Vallianatos
By the way, I'll be using your site to practice my French, and I'll
recommend it to everyone I know.
